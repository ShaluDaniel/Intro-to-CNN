# Intro-to-CNN

Training a classifier for handwritten digits that has over 99% accuracy on the famous MNIST dataset.

 
Keras is one of the leading high-level neural networks APIs written in Python and supports multiple back-end neural network computation engines. It runs on top of the machine learning platform TensorFlow.
The project focuses to build a neural network model using Keras for handwritten image recognition.
